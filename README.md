# Web App "Reisi Eestis"

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

In the backend you should start by running:

### `npm i`

This will install the necessary packages. Next you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the backend server. If port 3307 is already in use, you can use another open port in the last line of the code:

### `app.listen('3307', () => { console.log('Server started on port 3307'); });`

In the frontend directory you should first start out by running:

### `npm i`

This will download the necessary packages for the code. Next up you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
